# Comparing-ML_Algorithms

This is a simple,**comparative analysis** of some of the machine learning classification algorithms,namely:
* 1.Single layer Perceptron 
* 2.Decision Trees
* 3.Random Forest
* 4.Naive Bayes
* 5.Logistic Regression
* 6.A stacked ensemble,with 3 Random Forest classifiers at level 0 and Logistic Regression as the meta-classifier

The algorithms were compared on the basis of the accuarcies acheived and the two best performing algorithms- Random Forest and Stacked Ensemble were compared
using the classification report and confusion matrix.

The publicly available CICIDS dataset has been used for the given analysis

All the models and the pre-processing functions have been imported from the sklearn package
